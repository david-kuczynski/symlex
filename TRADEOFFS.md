# Tradeoffs

## Potential reasons to use Symlex

- Symlex is designed to be simple with few concepts to understand
- Using Symlex results in more maintainable and testable code that is fundamental for agile development
- It has proven to be well suited for rapidly building microservices, CLI and single-page applications
- It comes complete with working examples which are the best form of documentation
- Built on top of well documented and tested standard components
- Contains everything to create full-featured Web applications: Service container, REST routing & Twig template engine
- Lower complexity and improved performance compared to Symfony standard edition and many other frameworks
- Plain classes are used wherever possible to avoid vendor lock-in and enable framework independent code reuse (other 
frameworks often try to lock you in with proprietary annotations and specific base classes you have to inherit from)
- You can use it with Symfony Components and any other PHP library out there (just no support for bundles, see below)
- Even if you choose not to use Symlex, you might find lots of inspiration for your own projects (for example, you
can build your own framework around the [micro-kernel](https://github.com/symlex/di-microkernel) or learn 
how to integrate JavaScript with PHP)

## Potential reasons not to use Symlex

- Symlex is not backed by a company and has a small community, see [history](https://github.com/symlex/symlex#history) (you're welcome to join us)
- Development is mostly driven by a [single developer](https://blog.liquidbytes.net/about/) depending on the needs of 
specific applications (development started to have a high-performance replacement for FOSRestBundle)
- It is not good for developers who are not comfortable reading at least small amounts of framework code as not 
everything is documented 100% (you're welcome as ask for help via email or send additional docs as pull request)
- There is no support for bundles in Symlex. Using Symfony bundles often adds complexity to the overall 
architecture: They hide bootstrap/configuration details and encourage to build bloated applications. 
Symlex is designed to build focused, lean and fully testable applications. Writing meaningful component tests is not 
possible, if certain functionality is exclusively encoded in framework configuration files or magically generated by 
bundles (acceptance tests can be created, but they are slow and not suitable for test driven development or refactoring tasks)
- Symlex is not good if you prefer configuration over coding (annotations are not supported as they are difficult to test)
- Copy and pasting code from Stack Overflow or the Symfony documentation sometimes won't work without 
understanding it and adapting it a little e.g. when it comes to service configuration or routing
