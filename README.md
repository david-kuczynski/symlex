Silex + Symfony2
================

This boilerplate app is built on Silex, Symfony Components (for dependency injection instead of Pimple)
plus Sympathy Components, which add routing and bootstrapping. Symfony2 code should run without
major modifications. Bundles are not supported.

After cloning this repository, you have to run composer to fetch external dependencies:

    composer update
