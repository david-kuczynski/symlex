Symlex - Symfony 2 blended with Silex 
=====================================

This ready-to-use boilerplate app is built on Silex, Symfony Components (for dependency injection instead of Pimple)
plus Sympathy Components, which add routing and bootstrapping. Twitter Bootstrap, RequireJS and AngularJS are used for the example front-end code.

After cloning this repository, you have to run composer to fetch external dependencies:

    composer update
