Silex Boilerplate
=================

This boilerplate app is built on Silex, Symfony Components (for dependency injection instead of Pimple)
plus Sympathy Components, which add routing and bootstrapping.

After cloning/downloading, you have to run composer and bower to fetch external dependencies:

    composer update
    cd web
    bower update
